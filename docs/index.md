I'm a Software Developer and Engineering Graduate from the University of Waterloo. I have a BASc. in Mechatronics Engineering and a MASc. in Electrical Engineering, withe focuses on controls and robotics.

For a more technical profile, you can see [my LinkedIn page](http://www.linkedin.com/in/wesley-b-fisher).

I'm developing this site as a place to share different projects that I work on. In the future, I'm hoping to use it to write about things I've been learning about software development and other areas.
